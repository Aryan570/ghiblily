This is my Portfolio Website inspired by Studio Ghibli.   https://ghiblily.vercel.app/
Build from Nextjs, TailwindCSS, and Howler.js (react_use_audio_player).
The website shows my most important projects and other projects you can see in my GitHub.
The website isn't professional, was never meant to be professional, but was created to introduce you to the world of Ghibli.


Challenges and Learnings :
- HowlerJs doesn't work well with react(It didn't work for me, I don't know about you). Had to use react-use-audio-player and I would recommend this if you want to use music in your future apps 
- Had to learn about nodemailer for sending messages straight to my Gmail, instead of showing a popup for mail.
_ Learnt about React Parallax.
- Image Optimisation.

Current Issues:
- Very slow to load as there are so many assets to download. Improve LCP
- Need to make a skeleton as the app is loading.
- Improve mobile view
