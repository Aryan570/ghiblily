## Ghiblily
If you follow me, you know that I made this Ghibli-inspired portfolio website originally in June 2023. This is its new 2025 version with added features, even more stunning.

>A side rant: Stop creating AI Studio Ghibli art. If you haven&apos;t even watched its movies, you can&apos;t possibly understand what Studio Ghibli is. Stop creating AI slop, it is an insult to their work, and it infuriates millions of real fans like me so much.

In the new website, I have added a blog section/page also, where I would be sharing all the stuff going on in my life, some technical, some more personal. So definitely look out for that.
I&apos;m still unsure of the light mode colorscheme of the website, so I&apos;m open to any suggestions.
